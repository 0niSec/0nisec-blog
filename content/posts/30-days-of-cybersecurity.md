## UPDATE 01-01-2025

This challenge was a little more than I was able to handle and as a result I won't be continuing this. It's really hard to do 30 challenges in 30 days in a row with the responsibilities and little free time that I have right now at this point in life. I was only able to get one challenge actually completed and had started another but life got in the way and I have not been able to come back to it yet.

I'm not going to delete this or the one article that I did get done for this challenge. The tags will stay the same and they'll still be available and searchable, but you won't see any more articles with the `30-days-of-cyber` tag.

This does not mean I'm not interested anymore or don't want to do hacking or security related things. On the contrary, I'm still quite motivated to change my career and get into infosec. I'll be adding more articles as I have the free time.

Sorry to anyone that was looking forward to more articles coming off from this challenge. But, I hope you'll stick around and find other articles I've written that pique your interest.

## Why Am I Doing This?

I wanted to come up with some sort of challenge for myself that would let me a.) add projects to my resume and b.) add to this blog.

## The Challenge

The challenge is simple. As best as I can with the limited time I have every day, I want to find something to either learn or do related to infosec and cybersecurity. Every day once I've finished the task I set for myself, I'll write up that days' blog post. I don't want to limit myself in terms of projects/topics but some things that have come to mind while brainstorming this are:

1. HTB machines
2. Programming projects (that are small enough to complete with the time I have)
3. HTB Academy articles (where I'd write up a blog post on what I learned, trying to not just be a summary)

The programming projects can be anything from learning about writing malware, security tools, etc. This list doesn't encompass everything but I'm sure it covers a lot of things I could do.

I also want to make sure that I'm not just doing things I'm comfortable with. I want to push myself to learn new things and get out of my comfort zone. Hopefully I'm able to do that.

Because I work full time and have two kids, I may miss a day. I will absolutely try not to so that I can keep to the spirit of the challenge but give me some grace here.

## What Next?

Look for the articles tagged with [30 days of cyber](/tags/30-days-of-cyber). Posts should also start with a "Day..." title and can be found using that.
