## Who Am I?

I'm a dad of two daughters who enjoys video games, coding, and technology. This blog was created as a way to get better at taking notes for CTFs and somewhere where I can just write about anything cybersecurity related. It also gives me an excuse to learn new things.

## Where To Start

Feel free to poke around [the blog](/posts) for all the blog posts (that's why you're here isn't it?). Each post will have some tags that can be used to find similar posts as well.

## Socials

You can find me on these sites here
